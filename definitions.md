Title IV-D of the Social Security Act (Title IV-D) establishes a state-federal partnership to provide child support services. States must have a single statewide agency that receives the federal funding and administers the program.
Title IV-D Section 17304 outlines the establishment of local child support agencies in California. Each county is required to create a separate department responsible for:
Establishing, modifying, and enforcing child support obligations, including medical support and spousal support orders.
Determining paternity for children born out of wedlock.
Referring cases requiring criminal enforcement services to the district attorney.
Ensuring accessibility and accountability of local child support agencies to the public.
The director of the California Department of Child Support Services oversees these agencies and ensures compliance with federal and state laws.
