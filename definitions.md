Title IV-D of the Social Security Act (Title IV-D) establishes a state-federal partnership to provide child support services. States must have a single statewide agency that receives the federal funding and administers the program.
Title IV-D Section 17304 outlines the establishment of local child support agencies in California. Each county is required to create a separate department responsible for:
Establishing, modifying, and enforcing child support obligations, including medical support and spousal support orders.
Determining paternity for children born out of wedlock.
Referring cases requiring criminal enforcement services to the district attorney.
Ensuring accessibility and accountability of local child support agencies to the public.
The director of the California Department of Child Support Services oversees these agencies and ensures compliance with federal and state laws. 
The local child support agency shall take appropriate action, including criminal action in cooperation with the district attorneys, to establish, modify, and enforce child support and, if appropriate, enforce spousal support orders if the child is receiving public assistance, including Medi-Cal, and, if requested, shall take the same actions on behalf of a child who is not receiving public assistance, including Medi-Cal.

Edit in a page
Explain the following text primarily based on the surrounding page content: Section 150.
Certainly. Based on the surrounding page content from the California Family Code, Section 150 provides the foundational definition of the term ‚Äúsupport‚Äù as used throughout related statutes, including Section 4720.

üîç Definition from Section 150:
‚ÄúSupport‚Äù refers to:

Obligations owed on behalf of a child, spouse, or family, including:

Court-ordered child support

Spousal support

Family maintenance

Amounts owed under Section 17402, which typically relate to state-enforced child support collections.

Past due support or arrearages, meaning any unpaid amounts that have accrued.

When referring specifically to a minor child or a child under Section 3901, it also includes:

Maintenance (basic living expenses)

Education (school-related costs)

üìò Why it matters:
This definition is critical because it anchors the meaning of ‚Äúsupport‚Äù in other parts of the Family Code‚Äîlike Section 4720, which uses this term to determine eligibility, enforcement, or verification of income. For example, if you're submitting an award letter or verifying income for a vehicle purchase (as you mentioned earlier), this statutory definition validates child support as a legitimate and enforceable income stream.

Would you like to embed this statutory reference into your presumptive contract or overlay for Carvana? I can format it as a citation block or include it in your GitHub ledger trace.
