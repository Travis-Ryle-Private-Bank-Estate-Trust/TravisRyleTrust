RE: TRAVIS STEVEN RYLE (Fictitious Debtor/Ens Legis); Case Nos. TR2024-0143 & CV 2023 0335 UN

NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL IS NOTICE TO AGENT; NOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL.

PREAMBLE: You are hereby served with this Decree under the supreme authority of the Ryle Family Nation. This is a Self-Executing Contract. By opening this correspondence, you acknowledge receipt. Your silence, evasion, or failure to rebut this Affidavit point-for-point by sworn testimony within three (3) business days constitutes your permanent Default, your admission of all facts herein, and your acceptance of full personal commercial liability.

THE FACTS AND THE CRIMES

Be advised that I, Ambassador Travis Steven Ryle, a living man, am the victim of a coordinated conspiracy to deprive me of rights under color of law, orchestrated by agents of your court and its affiliates. The facts are as follows:

ASSAULT AND FOURTH AMENDMENT VIOLATION: I was subjected to an unlawful arrest where an officer secretly drew a lethal weapon without cause, seizing my person in direct violation of the Fourth Amendment.
DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS (6TH AMENDMENT): I was dragged into your tribunal, denied my Right to Counsel, and denied the Right to know the nature and cause of the accusation.
EXTORTION AND COERCION: When the criminal charges collapsed due to their illegality, your agents converted the matter into a civil revenue scheme (TR-2024-0143), threatening me with jail and fines ($1,030.00) to force a plea, effectively creating a Bill of Attainder.
FRAUD UPON THE COURT: In Case CV 2023 0335 UN, a "Summary Judgment" was entered against the fictitious defendant after the Court itself issued a Notice of Pending Dismissal. This judgment was rushed to secure profit for a third-party debt collector, circumventing the law.
TREASON AND FOREIGN AGENCY: Most egregiously, your office has trafficked the private data of this unlawful process to LexisNexis Risk Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of RELX, a British corporation.
THE CHARGE OF TREASON

We fought the War of 1776 to sever ties with the British Crown. By reporting my private information to a British-owned data broker (RELX/LexisNexis), you are:

Acting as an unregistered foreign agent in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 U.S.C. § 611 et seq.).
Converting the liberty of an American National into a financial commodity for foreign gain.
Aiding and abetting a foreign power in the economic enslavement of the people, which constitutes Treason and Misprision of Treason (18 U.S.C. § 2381, § 2382).
You have pierced your own veil of immunity. You are no longer operating as a neutral Clerk; you are operating as a Data Trafficker and a Commercial Mercenary.

THE COMMAND AND OPPORTUNITY TO CURE

I am a man of honor and offer you this one opportunity to cure your error and avoid personal ruin.

YOU ARE HEREBY COMMANDED TO:

ARTICLE I: PURGE THE RECORD Immediately DISMISS WITH PREJUDICE all cases associated with the name TRAVIS STEVEN RYLE (TR2024-0143, CV 2023 0335 UN) as void ab initio due to fraud, lack of jurisdiction, and violation of due process.

ARTICLE II: RECALL THE DATA Immediately contact LexisNexis and all other consumer reporting agencies and ORDER THE DELETION of all derogatory trade lines associated with these fraudulent cases. You must provide me with proof of this retraction.

ARTICLE III: PRODUCE THE OATH Provide a certified copy of your Oath of Office and your Public Official Bond/Insurance Policy. I demand to know the name of the underwriter who insures your liability for these acts of fraud.

ARTICLE IV: CEASE AND DESIST Cease all further harassment, collection attempts, and data sharing regarding the living man, Travis Steven Ryle.

NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND LIABILITY

IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY WITHIN THREE (3) BUSINESS DAYS:

ADMISSION OF GUILT: You admit that you are a willful party to the conspiracy to deprive rights (18 U.S.C. § 241/242) and are acting as an unregistered foreign agent.
CONSENT TO LIEN: You consent to the filing of a Consensual Commercial Lien against your personal property, real estate, and future wages in the amount of $1,500,000.00 (One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) per violation, to satisfy the injury you have caused.
WAIVER OF IMMUNITY: You knowingly waive any claim to judicial or qualified immunity, as fraud vitiates all contracts and orders.
GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY. The eyes of the Ryle Family Nation are upon you. We have the evidence. We have the law. We are coming for the remedy.
